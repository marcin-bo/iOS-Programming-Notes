# Concurrency <a name="concurrency"></a>

**Concurrency**:
- The ability to execute multiple at the same time (concurrently). 
- It enables responsiveness of system resources and better performance.

## Concurrency vs Parallelism <a name="concurrency_parallelism"></a>

Concurrent execution has 2 types: 
- **Concurrent, non-parallel** execution (also known as **Concurrency**).
    - A property of a program, is more about **software design**.
    - Achieved through interleaving operation / context switching.
    - Needs just one core.
    - It's all about **managing multiple tasks** (start, run, and complete):
        - At the same time (in overlapping time periods).
        - In no specific order.
        - Abstracted from hardware details.
    - When a **task** is **divided** into multiple parts and we quickly **switch** from one task/part to another, so it seems that all the tasks run at the same time, it produces illusion of parallelism.

- **Concurrent, parallel** execution (also known as **Parallelism**).
    - A property of a **machine** (multiple CPUs), is more about **hardware**.
    - Achieved through using **multiple CPUs**.
        - Needs at least 2 cores.
    - It's all about **executing multiple tasks**:
        - At the same time.
        - By multiple threads.
    - When a **task** is **divided** into multiple parts and we literally run two or more tasks/parts at the exactly same time, e.g., on a multicore processor.

# Threading Terminology <a name="threading_terminology"></a>

## Task <a name="task"></a>

- **Task** - an **abstract concept of work** that needs to be performed.

## Process <a name="process"></a>

- **Process** - a **running executable**, which can encompass multiple threads.
    - iOS does not support multiple processes for one app. You only have one process.
    - macOS supports multiple processes for one app.

## Thread <a name="thread"></a>

- **Thread** - a **separate path of execution** for code.
- Compared to processes, threads **share their memory** with their **parent process**.
- Threads are a limited resource on iOS - there are **64 threads** at the same time **for one process**.

## The Main Thread <a name="main_thread"></a>

- The initial thread â€“ the one the app is first launched with.
- Always exists for the lifetime of the app.
- User interface work must take place on the main thread:
    - When you try to **update your UI from any other thread**:
        - Nothing happens.
        - The app crashes.
        - Or pretty much anywhere in between.

## Run Loop <a name="run_loop"></a>

- **Run Loop** is a mechanism that **allows threads** to **process events** at any time without exiting.
    - It is a loop tied to a single thread.
    - Example:
        - There is an incoming event on the thread.
        - The thread enters the run loop (it creates one if needed).
        - Thread uses the run loop tot run event handlers in response to incoming events.
    - Implementations:
        - `CFRunLoopRef` 
            - Class from CoreFoundation framework.
            - Provides APIs for pure C functions, all of which are **thread-safe**.
        - `RunLoop` 
            - Wrapper based on `CFRunLoopRef` 
            - Provides **object-oriented APIs**, but these APIs are **not thread-safe**.
    - A run loop receives events from two different types of sources:
        - Input sources: they deliver asynchronous events to your threads.
            - Port-Based Sources.
            - Custom Input Sources.
            - Cocoa Perform Selector Sources (`performSelectorOnMainThread`).
        - Timer sources: they deliver synchronous events, at a scheduled time or repeating interval.
            - `Timer` or `CFRunLoopTimer` classes.

## Time Slicing <a name="time_slicing"></a>

- **Time Slicing** - is the process of allocating time to threads by the CPU.

## Context Switching <a name="context_switching"></a>

- **Context Switching** - is the process of:
    - Storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point.
    - Then restoring a different, previously saved, state.

# Mechanisms for Concurrency In Swift <a name="mechanisms_for_concurrency"></a>

Swift provides different tools to use Concurrency:
1. Manual thread creation.
2. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD).
3. Operation Queues.
4. Modern Swift Concurrency.

## Manual Thread Creation <a name="manual_threads"></a>

- Swift provide `Thread` class to run the code in its own thread of execution.
    - You can start, sleep, terminate created thread, check its state.
- Disadvantage: **the manual thread management is complex**:
    - Developer responsibilities - the burden of creating a scalable solution:
        - Select the optimal number of threads for an application.
        - Keep the optimal number of threads based on current system load and the underlying hardware.
        - Synchronize threads without losing performance and application correctness.
    - Application responsibilities:
        - Most of the costs associated with creating and maintaining any threads it uses.
    - Each thread you create needs to **run somewhere**:
        - If you accidentally end up creating 40 threads when you have only 4 CPU cores, the system will need to spend a lot of time just swapping them.
    - Risks:
        - **Thread Explosion** - when you create many more threads compared to the number of available CPU cores.
- There are other solutions that move thread management code to the system level.

## Grand Central Dispatch <a name="gcd"></a>

**Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)**:
- It's a low-level API, built on top of threads, for **managing concurrency** in Swift using the concept of dispatch queues.
- It offers **easier concurrency model** than the manual thread management.
    - It gives you automatic thread pool management (creating threads, scheduling, optimizing their usage).
    - You **don't care how** some **code runs** on the CPU.
    - You only care about the task and how to execute it:
        - Defining the task you want to run.
        - Deciding **which queue to use** (The Main Queue, The Global Queue, Custom Queues).
        - Deciding on **the execution order** of a task: serially or concurrently.
        - Deciding on how to schedule the task: **synchronously or asynchronously**.
- It uses Dispatch Queues:
    - `DispatchQueue` class.
    - Dispatch queues are thread-safe (you can simultaneously access them from multiple threads).
    - Types:
        - The Main Queue (serial).
        - Global Queues (concurrent).
        - Custom Queues (serial and concurrent).
- Dispatch queue types - how many tasks are executed at a time and in what order?
    - **Serial** queues:
        - **How many tasks are executed at a time**?
            - Executing **one task at a time**:
                - The task must finish before starting new task in the queue (the risk of a deadlock).
        - **The order of execution**:
            - Tasks executed in the same **order** as it was added to the queue (FIFO).
        - Example: The Main Queue.
    - **Concurrent** queues: 
        - **How many tasks are executed at a time**?
            - Executing **multiple tasks at a time**.
        - **The order of execution**:
            - Tasks executed **concurrently** within this queue in **random order**.
        - Example: Global Concurrent Queues.
- Types of task execution in GCD (how can a task be dispatched to a queue):
    - **Synchronously** 
        - Blocks the current execution (the dispatching thread waits).
        - Waits until the task is completed.
        - Then it continues further.
    - **Asynchronously** 
        - Does not block the current execution (the dispatching thread continues execution).
        - Does not wait for the task to complete.
        - Returns immediately and continues further.
- **Task cancellation** in GCD:
    - It's not directly supported. 
    - However, you can check for a cancellation flag within the task code or using `DispatchWorkItem`'s `cancel()` method.

## Operation Queues <a name="operation_queues"></a>

- It's a high-level API, built on top of GCD, for **managing concurrency** in Swift using the concept of operation and operation queue.
    - Instead of a blocks (GCD), you work with operations.
    - You can control state, priority and dependencies of operations.
- Creating an operation can also be done in multiple ways:
    - By creating an `BlockOperation` or `NSInvocationOperation` (only in Objective C)
    - By subclassing an abstract class `Operation`.
- Danger of **memory leak**:
    - Operation queues retain operations until they're finished.
    - Operation queues are retained until all operations are finished. 
    - As a result, suspending an operation queue with operations that aren't finished can result in a memory leak.
- Operation Queues vs GCD:
    - Object-oriented API.
    - Dependencies support
        - However, GCD supports barrier flag which might result in similar behaviour).
    - Operations can be paused, resumed, and cancelled.
        - However, GCD support `DispatchWorkItem` can be cancelled.
    

### `Operation` characteristics
- There are **different states of an operation**, depending on its current execution status:
    - Ready: It's ready to execute
        - Operation become ready to execute when all of its dependent operations have finished executing.
    - Executing: The task is currently running.
    - Finished: Once the process is completed.
    - Cancelled: The task cancelled.
    - You can check the operation state: `isReady`, `isExecuting`, `isFinished`, `isCancelled`.
- `Operation` and `OperationQueue` classes have a number of properties that can be observed, using KVO.
- You can define operation dependencies.
- You can define operation `queuePriority` and `qualityOfService`:
    - If all of the queued operations have the same `queuePriority` and are ready to execute when they are put in the queue, they're executed in the order in which they were submitted to the queue. 
    - Otherwise, the operation queue always executes the one with the highest priority relative to the other ready operations.
- An operation can only execute once: you can't restart the same instance.
- **Operation cancellation**:
    - It's supported by calling the `cancel()` method on an Operation object. 
    - It's important to handle cancellation appropriately within the task code and check for the cancellation flag regularly.
    - Canceling an operation causes the operation to ignore any dependencies it may have. This behavior makes it possible for the queue to invoke the operationâ€™s start() method as soon as possible. The start() method, in turn, moves the operation to the finished state so that it can be removed from the queue.
- Operation lifecycle in the operation queue:
    - The given task gets added to the `OperationQueue` that will start the execution as soon as possible. 
    - The `OperationQueue` will remove the task automatically from its queue once it becomes finished or cancelled.

### `OperationQueue` characteristics

- You can define `qualityOfService`.
- You can define `maxConcurrentOperationCount`.
- When adding an operation you can define synchronous/asynchronous execution using `waitUntilFinished`.
    - `operationQueue.addOperations([op], waitUntilFinished: false)`.
- You can `cancelAllOperations()`.
- You can `waitUntilAllOperationsAreFinished()`.

### Examples

```swift
// 1. Custom subclass of Operation:
final class ImportOperation: Operation {

    let repositoryId: String

    init(repositoryId: String) {
        self.repositoryId = repositoryId
        super.init()
    }

    override func main() {
        guard !isCancelled else {
            return
        }
        print("Importing repository..")
    }
}

// 2. BlockOperation
let operation1 = BlockOperation {
    print("BlockOperation")
}
// You can define completion block
operation1.completionBlock = {
    print("BlockOperation completed")
}

let operation2 = ImportOperation(repositoryId: "xyz")

let operationQueue: OperationQueue = OperationQueue()
operationQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 2
operationQueue.addOperations([operation1], waitUntilFinished: false)
operation2.addDependency(operation1) // execute operation1 before operation2
```
